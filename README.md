# logfire

LogFire is a Scala API (DSL) for rule-based programming,
based on the Rete algorithm. It is specifically designed for
monitoring event streams, for example emitted by a running
program, also referred to as runtime verification.
Using Scala's support for defining DSLs allows to write
rules elegantly as part of Scala programs. This combination 
appears attractive from a practical point of view.
The Rete algorithm has been modified to support events
(a special kind of facts with short lifespan).
