========================================
Generating jar file from within Eclipse:
========================================

Eclipse has a build-in option to generate runnable jars, but it is well hidden. 
Also it does not recognize Scala's main() signatures, so you will have to create a Java class 
with a main() method.

Create a Java class with a main() method which simply forwards the call to 
your Scala code.

Then right click on your newly created Java class and select: 
Run As -> Java Application. This will create a runnable configuration 
which will later be used as a part of your runnable jar.

Now you are ready to dig out the runnable jar option from the Eclipse's menu: 
File -> Export -> Java -> Runnable JAR file

In the presented dialog select the Launch Configuration you have created 
earlier (in step2), name your jar (myapp.jar), select your dependency export 
options and click finish.

The jar will be created in the Eclipse's workspace by default.

Run the jar using the line: scala myapp.jar

Generating scaladoc:
====================

This is done from the command line:

scaladoc -d doc src/rete/*.scala src/rete/graphviz/*.scala
