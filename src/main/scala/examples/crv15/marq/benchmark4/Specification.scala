/*
 * This specification is from the setting of SQL queries being taken as 
 * input to a server and then used on a database. To prevent malicious 
 * behaviour such as a query string â€™; DROP TABLE table; it is necessary 
 * to sanitise these query strings before use. It is also necessary to 
 * ensure that no query strings derived from the original query string are 
 * used before sanitisation. The property we want to monitor is that every 
 * string s2 derived from an input string s1 is sanitised before use. Note 
 * that once a string has been sanitised then all strings derived from it 
 * are safe to use. We abstractly capture the input of a string as input(string), 
 * the derivation of a string as derive(string,string), the use of a string as 
 * use(string) and the sanitisation of a string as sanitise(string). As we want 
 * to capture an arbitrary number of derivations, it is not possible to quantify 
 * over the used string in QEA. We capture the property in the following 
 * unquantified QEA, which uses non-determinism to track derived strings.
 * 
 * Events:
 * 
 * - input(string)
 * - derive(string,string)
 * - sanitise(string)
 * - use(string)
 * 
 * Note: strings derived from a dirty string stay dirty forever with the spec below. 
 * This should (most likely) be changed.
